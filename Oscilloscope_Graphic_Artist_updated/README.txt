In this file there are two different sets of Gerbers. 
One is for board mount pots that should be mounted East-West (marked EW-pots), and the other for North-South (marked NS-pots). 
I've found some pots mounted differently depending on where the 'pointer' on the knob goes.
Both boards are identical except for this, and traces to accommodate. 
I have marked the timing caps of the oscillators with their respective letters (A,B,C,D) for easy swapping.
The BOM has the same reference designators as the original project, except where a few modifications were added.

please send me an email at phil@occupiedvr.com if anything is incorrect and I will update the project files.
